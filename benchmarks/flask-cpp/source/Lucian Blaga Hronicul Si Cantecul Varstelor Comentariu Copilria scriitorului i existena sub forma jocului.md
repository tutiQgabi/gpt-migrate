### Advantages

- Cracking software is cost-efficient and cheap. It is less costly than buying original software that not everyone can afford[^3^].
- Cracking software can be useful for students, beginners, and starters who want to learn and practice using software such as Adobe and Microsoft products, among others[^3^].
- Cracking software can allow users to bypass restrictions or limitations imposed by the original software developers, such as region locks, trial periods, or subscription fees.

### Disadvantages

- Cracking software can cause malware infections. Downloads of illegal software are frequently stuffed full of dangerous malware that can steal information, take screenshots, download more malware, or even encrypt files and demand ransom[^1^] [^2^].
- Cracking software can expose users to dodgy websites. To download cracked software, users generally need to visit sites that specialize in cracking, which are often full of popups, redirects, adware, or ransomware[^2^].
- Cracking software may not work properly. Many companies take steps to prevent their software from being pirated, such as adding digital rights management (DRM) or online verification systems. Cracked software may not function as intended or may stop working after updates[^2^].
- Cracking software is illegal and unethical. Cracking software violates the terms and conditions of the software developers and may result in legal consequences. It also deprives the developers of their rightful income and discourages them from creating more quality software.
- Cracking software can affect other devices on the network. Once malware has penetrated the security of one device via cracked software, it can travel over networks and infect other devices. This can compromise the security and privacy of family members or coworkers who share the same network[^2^].

In conclusion, cracking software is not worth the risks and costs involved. It is better to use legal and safe alternatives, such as free or open-source software, or to purchase original software from reputable sources.
